# Time series forecasting

### Research paper:

Modeling Long and Short-Term Temporal Patterns with Deep Neural Networks.(https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015)

### Dataset:

You can download the datasets mentioned in the paper at https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data.

### Bash script:
We give the examples to run different datasets in ele.sh, traffic.sh, solar.sh and stock.sh.

### Environment and Dependencies:
1.  Create Conda Environment with Python 3.7
2.  Install compatible PyTorch from https://pytorch.org/
3.  Create folder data and clone the dataset
4.  Run any Bash file on cmd or Power shell (windows)
